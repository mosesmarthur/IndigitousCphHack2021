# IndigitousCphHack2021

This is a global hackathon organized by Agapeliv partnering with Indigitous global team where participants around the world gather to solve problems facing their communities. #HACK convenes people from all backgrounds to use their skills, gifts, and expertise to impact the world. 

The dataset which we are going to solve is from KÃ¸benhavn Kommune about the trees plant around copenhagen in the past year and their Geographical location.

Lets try to crack this data so that we could add more value the town.
